This dataset comes from a subset of The National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) Global Historical Climatology Network daily (GHCNd) (GHCN-Daily). The GHCN-Daily is comprised of daily climate records from thousands of land surface stations across the globe! In particular, we are using data from the Ann Arbor Michigan location. 
The variables of interest are: 
- id : station identification code
- date : date in YYYY-MM-DD format (e.g. 2012-01-24 = January 24, 2012)
- element : indicator of element type
- TMAX : Maximum temperature (tenths of degrees C)
- TMIN : Minimum temperature (tenths of degrees C)
- value : data value for element (tenths of degrees C)

I aim to visualise this data using Matplotlib to document temperature changes for Tmax and Tmin over a time scale.
